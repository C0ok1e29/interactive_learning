				<p>Definition of an Adjective
                    According to the Cambridge Dictionary, an adjective is defined as “a word that describes a noun or pronoun.” The Collins Dictionary gives a more elaborate definition. According to it, “an adjective is a word such as ‘big’, ‘ dead’, or ‘ financial’ that describes a person or thing, or gives extra information about them. Adjectives usually come before nouns or after link verbs.”
                    Positive or Absolute Form
                    Comparative Form
                    Superlative Form</p>
                     
                   <p><h2>Positive Degree of Comparison:</h2>
                    The positive form or the Positive Degree of Comparison: is the form of the 
                    adjective used in the original form. For example: This book is interesting. 
                    This form of adjective is used when there is no other subject to be compared.</p>

                   <p><h2>Comparative Degree of Comparison</h2>
                    The Comparative form of the adjective is used when two subjects performing the 
                    same action or possessing the same quality are compared. For example: The book I read 
                    yesterday was more interesting than the one I read today.</p>

                   <p><h2>Superlative Degree of Comparison</h2>
                    The Superlative Degree of Comparison is used when comparing the same quality 
                    of two or more subjects and to represent that a subject is superior to two or more 
                    subjects in performing an action. For example: This fantasy novel is the most interesting
                    book that I have ever read.</p>

                    <p><h2>Types of Adjectives</h2>
                    Adjectives can be divided into different categories based on their functions when 
                    used in a sentence. The different types of adjectives are.
                    Possessive Adjectives
                    Interrogative Adjectives
                    Demonstrative Adjectives
                    Compound Adjectives</p>

                    <p><h2>Possessive Adjectives:</h2>
                    These adjectives, like possessive, are used to show or represent 
                    possession of a quality. For example: my, your, his, her, their, its, whose, etc.</p>

                    <p><h2>Interrogative Adjectives:</h2>
                    An adjective that is used to modify a noun or a pronoun by asking a question is called
                    an interrogative adjective. There are only a few adjectives that can be termed as interrogative 
                    adjectives. They are whose, what and which.</p>

                   <p><h2>Demonstrative Adjectives:</h2>
                    Demonstrative adjectives are mainly used to describe the position 
                    of a subject (a noun or pronoun) in space or time. This, that, these and those are 
                    the demonstrative adjectives in English.</h2>

                    <p><h2> Compound Adjectives:</h2>
                    Compound adjectives consist of two or more adjectives that are combined
                     together to form an adjective that can be used to modify the subject.
                      Some examples of compound adjectives are cotton-tailed, curly-haired, 
                      absent-minded, happy-go-lucky, etc.</p>
                    
                    <p><h2>How to Use Adjectives in Sentences?</h2>
                    Adjectives are known to give your writing and speech a very flowery look. It aids in making it descriptive and also in giving your readers and listeners a visual treat. However, stuffing it with too many adjectives can make it look or sound vague and unclear. This would only lead to misunderstanding of your content. Knowing when, where and how to use adjectives is a skill that you should master.
                    Any piece of writing should be clear and precise. Find out if there is a word that specifically means whatever you are trying to convey. For example: quick, swift, hasty, fleet, etc. are all adjectives that mean ‘very fast’. Likewise, contented, cheerful, merry, joyful, ecstatic, delighted, etc. are all words that describe different degrees of happiness. There is also another concept that you should know. There is a particular order in which you should place adjectives when you are using two or more adjectives to describe the same subject or object.
                    Examples of Adjectives
                    If you are wondering what part of speech a colour or a number belongs to, do not waste any more time thinking about it. All colours and numbers are classified as adjectives. Adjectives are words that modify nouns but in most cases, they can be seen to be doing much more than that. Given below are the various ways in which adjectives can function and be used.
                    Adjectives as Complements
                    Adjectives can act as complement that modify nouns that act as subjects and objects. When the adjective describes the object in a sentence, it is called an object complement and when it is used to describe the subject in a sentence, it is referred to as a subject complement. They are seen to be used in sentences which are seen to use the following patterns:
                    SVC – Aaron is good.
                    In the above example, the adjective is ‘good’ and it is used to describe the subject ‘Aaron’ and so it is called a subject complement.
                    SVOC – The movie made Karthik sleepy.
                    Here, the adjective ‘sleepy’ describes the object ‘Karthik’ and so comes under the category of object complements.
                    Adjectives as Coordinates
                    When two or more adjectives are used to describe the same noun in a sentence, they are called coordinate adjectives. Coordinate adjectives are often separated by a comma or the conjunction ‘and’.
                    For example:
                    The mobile phone is easy to use and handy.
                    My cousin is tall and thin.
                    Multifunctional Adjectives
                    Adjectives can be made to function like or take the role of nouns in a sentence, and sometimes, a noun, when used to describe or provide more information about another noun, can perform the role of an adjective.
                    For example:
                    I like my English teacher.
                    In the above example, the word ‘English’ is generally considered a noun as it represents a language and it is a proper noun. But here, it is used to describe the noun ‘teacher’ which makes it an adjective.
                    It is our duty to tend to the poor and the oppressed.
                    In this sentence, the words ‘the poor’ and ‘the oppressed’ pass off as nouns as it refers to ‘poor people’ and ‘oppressed people’. So, when adjectives are preceded by the article ‘the’, it often refers to a category of people which makes the adjective a noun.
