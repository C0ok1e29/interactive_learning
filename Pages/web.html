                    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It provides a way to structure content such as text, images, videos, links, and other media on web pages. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers, which render the content according to the instructions provided in the HTML code.
                <br>
                    HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. Attributes provide additional information about an element and are included within the opening tag.</p>
                <br>
                <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the foundation for creating web pages. It allows you to structure content using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, tables, and forms. Additionally, HTML enables you to embed multimedia elements like images, audio, and video. You can create hyperlinks and navigation menus for seamless user interaction, as well as build forms for data input and submission. With HTML's support for responsive design, you can ensure your web pages adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Moreover, proper HTML markup aids in search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility, making your content more discoverable and usable for all users. Finally, HTML works in tandem with CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic behavior, offering a complete toolkit for creating engaging web experiences.</p>
