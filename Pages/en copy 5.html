				<p><h2>Definition of a Pronoun</h2>
                    A pronoun is defined as ‘a word that is used instead of a noun or a noun phrase’, according to the Cambridge Dictionary. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines pronouns as ‘any of a small set of words (such as I, she, he, you, it, we, or they) in a language that are used as substitutes for nouns or noun phrases and whose referents are named or understood in the context’. According to the Collins Dictionary, ‘A pronoun is a word that you use to refer to someone or something when you do not need to use a noun, often because the person or thing has been mentioned earlier. Examples are ‘it’, ‘she’, ‘something’, and ‘myself’.’
