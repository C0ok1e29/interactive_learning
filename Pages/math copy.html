				<p>Some of the real-life examples of statistics are:
                    To find the mean of the marks obtained by each student in the class whose strength is 50. The average value here is the statistics of the marks obtained.
                    Suppose you need to find how many members are employed in a city. Since the city is populated with 15 lakh people, hence we will take a survey here for 1000 people (sample). Based on that, we will create the data, which is the statistic.
                    Basically, there are two types of statistics.

                    Descriptive Statistics
                    Inferential Statistics
                    In the case of descriptive statistics, the data or collection of data is described in summary. But in the case of inferential stats, it is used to explain the descriptive one. Both these types have been used on large scale.
                    
                    Descriptive Statistics
                    
                    The data is summarised and explained in descriptive statistics. The summarization is done from a population sample utilising several factors such as mean and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics is a way of organising, representing, and explaining a set of data using charts, graphs, and summary measures. Histograms, pie charts, bars, and scatter plots are common ways to summarise data and present it in tables or graphs. Descriptive statistics are just that: descriptive. They donâ€™t need to be normalised beyond the data they collect.
                    
                    Inferential Statistics
                    
                    We attempt to interpret the meaning of descriptive statistics using inferential statistics. We utilise inferential statistics to convey the meaning of the collected data after it has been collected, evaluated, and summarised. The probability principle is used in inferential statistics to determine if patterns found in a study sample may be extrapolated to the wider population from which the sample was drawn. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and study correlations between variables, and they can also be used to predict population sizes. Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.</p>
