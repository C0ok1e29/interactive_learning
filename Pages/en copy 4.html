				<p>An adverb, according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, is “a word that adds more information about place, time, manner, cause or degree to a verb, an adjective, a phrase or another adverb.” The Cambridge Dictionary defines an adverb as “a word that describes or gives more information about a verb, adjective, adverb, or phrase.”
                    The Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides a similar definition. It defines an adverb as “a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb and often used to show degree, manner, place, or time.” According to the Collins Dictionary, an adverb is defined as “a word such as ‘slowly’, ‘ now’, ‘very’, ‘politically’, or ‘ fortunately’ which adds information about the action, event, or situation mentioned in a clause.”
                    Adverbs are categorised into different types according to their functions when used in a sentence. Given below are the different types of adverbs.
                    
                    Adverbs of Manners

                    Adverbs of Time

                    Adverbs of Place

                    Adverbs of Frequency

                    Adverbs of Degree

                    Conjunctive Adverbs

                    Examples of Adverbs

                    Now that you know what adverbs are and how there are different types of adverbs, let us look at some adverbs example to see how they can be used effectively in sentences.
                    How Adverbs are Used in Sentences

                    Unlike other parts of speech, adverbs can be placed at any part of the sentence (beginning, middle or end), and make complete sense without sounding absurd. Another characteristic is that multiple adverbs can be used in a sentence. Have a look at the following examples to have a clear understanding of the same.
                    I was planning to go to the supermarket to buy some groceries. However, I did not find the time to go. So I ordered online.

                    My mom did not cook breakfast today. Therefore, we ended up making noodles for everyone.

                    Normally, we go to church on Sundays.</p>

                <p>What is an Adverb of Frequency?
                    An adverb of frequency is a word that is employed in a sentence to give more 
                    information about the verb, adjective or another adverb. Adverbs of frequency can
                    be placed after the noun or pronoun that acts as the subject and before the verb if there is just 
                    one verb in a sentence. If there is more than one verb in a sentence , 
                    the adverb of frequency can be positioned before the main verb.</p>
