                    Satellites are objects that orbit around a larger celestial body. In the context of the solar
                     system, they often refer to natural satellites, also known as moons, which orbit planets. 
                     These moons vary widely in size, composition, and characteristics, and they play 
                     significant roles in the dynamics and ecosystems of their respective planetary systems.
                     </p>

				<p> Additionally, artificial satellites, human-made objects launched into orbit around Earth or 
                    other celestial bodies, serve various purposes such as communication, navigation, weather monitoring, 
                    scientific research, and more. Both natural and artificial satellites contribute 
                  to our understanding of the solar system and beyond.</p>
