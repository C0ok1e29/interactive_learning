				<p>Indicative Mood
                    The most commonly used mood in the English language, the indicative mood, expresses facts, opinions and general statements. It is used to say if something did or did not happen. Here are some examples of sentences expressing the indicative mood.
                    Irene washed all the clothes yesterday.
                    We will be going to Dubai next month.
                    The temperature is 22°C in Bangalore.
                    Tomorrow is a holiday.
                    It is raining heavily.
                    </p>

				 <p> Subjunctive Mood
                    The subjunctive mood does not speak about objective facts. It includes opinions, intentions, beliefs and desires; in general, it portrays an individual’s state of mind. It is also used to present hypothetical situations.
                    Here are a few examples to help you understand.
                    The manager insisted that we attend the workshop on SEO writing and optimisation.

                    If you were me, what would you have done?
                    I believe that it will get better.ra</p>
<br>
                <p>Interrogative Mood
                    The interrogative mood is expressed through interrogative sentences. It indicates that it is a question with the motive of deriving an answer.
                    Are you planning to take up the course on resin art?
                    What are your plans for the weekend?
                    When are you coming back to Coimbatore?
                    Is this Priya’s new car?
                    Did you find the answer to that differential equation?</p>
<br>
               <p> Conditional Mood
              The conditional mood indicates the conditions under which a particular course of 
               action might or might not take place. Subordinating conjunctions such as
                ‘if’ and ‘when’ and modal verbs such as ‘would’, ‘might’ and ‘could’ can be used to 
                frame sentences in the conditional mood.
                Given below are some examples of sentences in the conditional mood.
                You will reach on time if you leave home by 7 a.m.
                We will meet you when we come to Bangalore the next time.
