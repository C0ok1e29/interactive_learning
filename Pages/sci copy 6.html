                    Commercial Energy- This type of energy is usually consumed by commercial entities and not by the residential or households. This energy is accessible to the consumers at
                     a price to be paid and is a non-renewable source of energy. Commercial sources like coal, petroleum, and electricity are bought and sold it to the users. Sometimes the

				<p>Conventional & Non-Conventional Source of Energy
                    Conventional Source of Energy- This source of energy is natural energy resources, that has been used for many years to produce light, heat, food, and electricity. 
                    The energy is further divided into Commercial and Non-commercial sources of energy. This energy is 
                    non-renewable and is available in limited quantity apart from hydro-electric power. Few types of conventional energy are Coal, natural gas, electricity, thermal power, cow-dung, straw, etc.
                    Non-Conventional Source of Energy- This source of energy is available in abundance in nature as it doesnâ€™t get exhausted easily and are renewable. It is economical, eco-friendly and used for 
                    domestic purposes. Few types of non- conventional energy are wind, sun, biological waste, etc to produce power and heat.</p>
