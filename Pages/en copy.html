				<p>Types of Moods in English Grammar with Examples

                    Mood is divided into three main categories in English grammar, namely,

                    Indicative mood
                    Imperative mood
                    Subjunctive mood
                    Indicative Mood

                    The most commonly used mood in the English language, the indicative mood, expresses facts, opinions and general statements. It is used to say if something did or did not happen. Here are some examples of sentences expressing the indicative mood.
                    Irene washed all the clothes yesterday.

                    We will be going to Dubai next month.

                    The temperature is 22°C in Bangalore.
                    Tomorrow is a holiday.

                    It is raining heavily.

                    Imperative Mood
                    Sentences with verbs conveying commands, orders, and requests are said to be in the imperative mood. In other words, it can be said that all imperative sentences are in the imperative mood. The actions stated in the imperative mood are yet to happen, and there are chances that they might not happen at all. These sentences take the infinitive form of the verb and exclude the subject. However, you can use nouns or noun phrases as a noun of address to specify who/whom the request, order or command is directed.
                    Look at the following examples.

                    Pick up the dress on your way.

                    Switch on the lights; it is getting dark.

                    Anu, can you please help me with this?

                    I wish I could have ice cream now.

                    If you were me, what would you have done?

                    I believe that it will get better.

                    The doctor recommended that I take complete rest for two days.

                    Interrogative mood and conditional mood are also learnt in addition to these most often. Let us look at each of these in detail.
                    Interrogative Mood.

                    The interrogative mood is expressed through interrogative sentences. It indicates that it is a question with the motive of deriving an answer.
