        <p class="s2para">Verbs in English Grammar
            In the English Language or any language for that matter, verbs happen to be an
            essential part of speech, without which it would be impossible to indicate what the subject is doing. 
            It refers to all actions, including those related to feelings and emotions. Verbs come in different 
            types and forms so that they can perform differently in order to provide complete meaning. Before we look 
            into the types of verbs and the verb forms, let us look at 
            how various dictionaries define the term ‘verb’.</p>

        <p class="s3para">What Is a Pronoun?
            A pronoun is used in the place of a noun. It substitutes the noun in a
             paragraph or piece of writing to avoid repetition of the noun. Pronouns can be 
             used in singular and plural forms. The verb used in the sentence should be used in accordance with
             the particular form of the pronoun used. </p>

        <p class="s4para">What Is an Adjective?
            An adjective is a part of speech that can be used to describe or provide more information 
            about a noun or pronoun that acts as the subject in a sentence.
             Adjectives are found after the verb or before the noun it modifies.</p>

        <p class="s5para">An adverb, according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, is “a word that adds more information about place, time, manner, cause or degree to a verb, an adjective, a phrase or another adverb.” The Cambridge Dictionary defines an adverb as “a word that describes or gives more information about a verb, adjective, adverb, or phrase.”
            The Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides a similar definition. It defines an adverb as “a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb and often used to show degree, manner, place, or time.” According to the Collins Dictionary, an adverb is defined as “a word such as ‘slowly’, ‘ now’, ‘very’, ‘politically’, or ‘ fortunately’ which adds information about the action, event, or situation mentioned in a clause.”
            Adverbs are categorised into different types according to their functions when used in a sentence. Given below are the different types of adverbs.
            
            Adverbs of Manners

            Adverbs of Time

            Adverbs of Place

            Adverbs of Frequency

            Adverbs of Degree

            Conjunctive Adverbs</p>
